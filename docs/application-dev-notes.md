# Notes related to application development

## What should have been done before starting with AI

- defined linters, typescript rules
- configure CSS framework (e.g. Pico) for the same UI/UX across application
- if letting AI generate CSS classes, strictly insist on reusable classes from one location
- add Svelte skills (Claude), best practices

## What I did right (I think)

- used AI -> bought Claude Pro plan, created a CLAUDE.md, used Claude Sonnet 4.5 (to save tokens)
- made a detail plan with technical and non-technical requirements - technology, environment, data structures
- created a plan with Claude
- using a plan for bigger changes
- clearing conversations when done, to save tokens

## Project development

Session quota was used up in usually around 1 hour of work, so I had to split my work into morning and evening sessions.
There is also a weekly quota which I reached one or two days before the reset.
